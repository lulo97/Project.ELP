But <em><ins>maintains these services (maintaining these services)</ins></em> for old people come with great cost, such as expensive medical equipments, <em><ins>nursing house (nursing home)</ins></em> and salary for people working in it. Some people the government should paying for the cost. Personally I argue that the families should take the responsibility and pay for the care of nursing house. The first reason that families can control the services quality that their elderly can receive. The second reason is the filial duty with their parents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The first point is by paying for the nursing home cost, families are motivate to monitor the quality of services and staff. <em><ins>Their will likely (They are likely)</ins></em> to visit to communicate with caregivers and spend time with their elderly. <em><ins>Futher more (Furthermore)</ins></em>, some families has unique expectations for how their parents should be treated. By paying for the care themself, they can choose a suitable nursing home depend on financial situation, culture values and conform level. For example, wealthy families in the United States or Japan often choose luxuly private nursing home for their elderly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The second point is about filial piety. Paying for the care of grandparents or parents is a way of showing <em><ins>respest (respect) </ins></em>and gratitude toward the people who raised us. It reflects the previous traditional family values such as love and responsibility. For instance, in Asian cultures, they consider taking care for their parents by living with them or paying for their care is a moral duty for children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To conclusion, while some people <em><ins>belive (believe) </ins></em>the cost of care for elderly in nursing home should be <em><ins>payed (paid) </ins></em>by the government, I believe that the families should the ones doing that responsibility.

Do you like art?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate</strong>: Growing up, art was a way for me to express myself and show my emotions through whatever medium I chose. I actually prefer art more than music in some ways. I like to paint, and I enjoy seeing how other people express themselves through their art as well.

Examiner</strong>: Do you think that art classes are important in school?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate</strong>: I feel that art is very subjective. Teaching basic theories about art is sometimes necessary so people can understand concepts like color theory and composition. However, I don’t think following strict methods on how to draw certain things is necessary. Everyone should have the freedom to let their creative mind go in whatever direction they want.</p>\n<p>- art is subjective (nghệ thuật là chủ quan)</p>\n<p>- color theory, composition (the way in which different elements of an artwork are combined)</p>\n<p>- let creative mind go in any direction they want</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Attemp to answer:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- Ideas: art help creativity, art help relax after a long hours of focus</p>\n<p>- I believe that art classes are indeed crucial in school because it helps grow creativity and imagination in students, and art also give students a chance to relax after long hours of focus on academic subjects like math or science.</p>\n<p>- Note:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ creativity, imagination</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ give a chance to relax</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ academic subjects</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>3.

I love her music — every time I put it on in my car, it changes my mood. I also enjoy sharing that experience with my friends. So yes, she’s definitely one of my top favorite artists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Attempt: My favorite artist is Phan Manh Quynh. He is a Vietnamese singer and also a songwriter. He is famous for many love songs, such as Co Chang Trai Viet Len Cay or Vo Nguoi Ta. I often listen to his song when I playing video games or doing home chores.

Do you have a pet at home?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate</strong>: I actually have two cats. I love animals, but especially cats — everything about them! One of my cats is called Ni and the other is Tuti. Ni kind of reflects my personality — she’s a bit lazy and introverted, just like me. I really love cats; they’re fluffy, friendly, and I enjoy their company.</p>\n<p>- Direct answer and pic a specific animal: I love animals, but expecially cats - everything about them!</p>\n<p>- Example: One of my cats is called Ni and the other is Tuti.</p>\n<p>- Why love them: I realy love cats because they are fluffy, friendly, and I enjoy their company.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Attempt</strong>: Yes, I do have a dog at home. He is a min pin dog, and his name is Bờm. I enjoy playing with him every time I can, and he is very fast. When we went for a walk, he would run to explore everything around and come back to us right after.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Attempt 2:</strong> Yes I do have a dog at home and his name is Bờm. He is a brown min pin dog and he is very playful and energetic. I love spending time with him whenever I can.

He always make me laugh with his funny little actions.</p>\n<p>- energetic and playful</p>\n<p>- got super excited</p>\n<p>- funny little actions</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>5. Examiner</strong>: Would you like a different pet in the future?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate</strong>: I used to have two ducks, but I had to give them to a shelter because I couldn’t take proper care of them at home. In the future, I’d love to have ducks again, maybe when I’m fully settled in my own house. It would be nice to revisit that memory.</p>\n<p>- Focus on one animal: Ducks</p>\n<p>- Example: Used to have a duck not now</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Attempt</strong>: Maybe when I settle down in my own house, then I would like to have a cat. Despite having a dog as a pet, I always love cats because they look really cute, more than dogs. Back then, when my grandparents used to have cats, I enjoyed hugging them and listening to their purr. That is why I will definitely own a cat someday.</p>\n<p>- Focus on one animals: Cats</p>\n<p>- Example: Used to play with grandparent's cat</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>6. Examiner: </strong>Do you prefer cats or dogs?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate</strong>: Definitely cats! I think it’s partly because I come from a Muslim family, and dogs are often seen as not very clean. So cats have always been the preferred pet in our home. I love everything about them — their personality, their looks, and the way they act.</p>\n<p>- Directly answer: Definitely cats</p>\n<p>- Because dog often seen as not clean in Muslim family</p>\n<p>- Because I love everything about cats, their personality, their looks, and the way they act</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Attempt</strong>: I would say I prefer cats to dogs. I find cats cuter, and I really like their personalities. They're independent, relaxed, and they just live freely without caring too much about others. I think that is pretty cool.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>7. Examiner:</strong> Now let’s talk about reading. How often do you read books?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Candidate</strong>: Back in middle school, I used to be really into books — it was basically my personality! I loved spending time alone just reading, and my family often told me to go outside because I read so much. Even when I did go out, I’d bring a book with me. Recently, I’ve fallen out of the habit because life’s been busy, but I still try to read about once every two months.</p>\n<p>- Useful sentences:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I used to be really into books</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Back in middle school/ Back then in my middle school</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I love spending time alone just reading</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Even when abc, I would xyz</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ I have fallen out of the habit/I have stopped doing it regularly</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Life have been busy</p>\n<p>- Answer in final sentence: I still try to read once every two months.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Attempt</strong>: I used to read books a lot, especially detective books. At my parents' home, I still have books stored in my desk, and if I have a chance to go back home, I would love to read them again. Nowadays, I rarely read because life has been busy, but I would say once every few months I will read a book.</p>\n<p>- Points:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Used to read book</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Now rarely read</p>\n<p>- Example: Have books in parents' home</p>\n<p>- Reason to rarely read: Life has been busy.</p>\n<p>- Feeling: Would love to have time to focus on read agian.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n

Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The question of who should bear the primary responsibility for transporting children to school is a key issue that reflects different views on the roles of the state and the family.

This collective approach is also more environmentally <strong>sustainable</strong> than having thousands of parents drive individual cars.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- From the perspective of = Xét từ quan điểm của ...</p>\n<p>- state responsibility = trách nhiệm của chính phủ</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ state = the whole system of a country</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ government = a part of a state, run by a group of people</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ state = rarely change, example: Việt Nam Cộng Hòa Dân Chủ (1945-1976), Cộng Hòa XHCN VN (1976-nay)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ government = changes by elections</p>\n<p>- clear benefits = lợi ích rõ ràng &lt;&gt; hidden benefits (bonus: direct/indirect benefits)</p>\n<p>- equity = bình đẳng</p>\n<p>- traffic management = quản lý giao thông</p>\n<p>- Firstly ..., Secondly ...</p>\n<p>- comprehensive system = hệ thống toàn diện</p>\n<p>- those residing in remote areas = những ai ở nơi xa</p>\n<p>- disadvantaged backgrounds = có điều kiện khó khăn</p>\n<p>- Thereby &lt;&gt; therefore</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Thereby = by doing that, example: He was hired, thereby he became the youngest employee in the office.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Therefore = as a result, example: He was the best candidate.

Advocates for this view contend that transporting children to school is an <strong>inherent</strong> part of <strong>parenting</strong> and daily family life. <strong>Furthermore</strong>, parental involvement allows for flexibility and often provides opportunities to <strong>nurture</strong> a child’s health through active <strong>commuting</strong>, such as walking or cycling. Assigning this cost and logistical burden entirely to the state may also be seen as an <strong>undue strain</strong> on public finances, potentially diverting funds from core educational programmes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- From the perspective of ..., Conversely ...</p>\n<p>- should be responsible = nên có trách nhiệm</p>\n<p>- stems from = có nguồn gốc từ ...</p>\n<p>- the fundamental obligation = nghĩa vụ cơ bản</p>\n<p>- parental care = sự chăm sóc của cha mẹ</p>\n<p>- parental involvement = sự có mặt của cha mẹ</p>\n<p>- active commuting = chủ động đi lại</p>\n<p>- Assigning this cost = việc giao toàn bộ chi phí</p>\n<p>- logistical burden = gánh nặng hậu cần</p>\n<p>- undue strain = căng thẳng quá mức</p>\n<p>- public finances = tài chính công</p>\n<p>- potentially diverting funds = có khả năng làm lệch hướng các nguồn vốn ...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- core educational programmes = các chương trình giáo dục chính</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, both sides present valid arguments, but neither perspective is entirely <strong>sustainable</strong> on its own. While parents should be encouraged to take responsibility for local <strong>commuting</strong> and promoting active travel, the government has a crucial role to play in providing transportation as a social <strong>safety net</strong>. Therefore, I maintain that governments must prioritize establishing safe, <strong>subsidized</strong> bus services for long-distance commuters and financially strained families, <strong>whilst</strong> simultaneously encouraging and supporting parents in all other instances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- both sides present valid arguments = cả hai bên đều có lý</p>\n<p>- neither perspective is entirely sustainable on its own = không có quan điểm nào trong cả hai quan điểm là hoàn toàn bền vững</p>\n<p>- crucial role to play = vai trò quan trọng</p>\n<p>- social safety net = mạng lưới xã hội an toàn</p>\n<p>- subsidized bus services = dịch vụ bus được trợ cấp</p>\n<p>- long-distance commuters = những người đi lại (học tập, làm việc) với khoảng cách xa</p>\n<p>- financial strained families = các gia đình có sự căng thẳng về tài chính</p>\n<p></p>\n

He often stars/acts in actions and sometimes in science-fiction movies. People might know him from his famous series John Wick, which started in 2014, and I really love this series but The Matrix is still the best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What I really like about him, beside his wonderful acting, is that his personality. He is the coolest actor and he has a good humor, which I can see from interviews with him. Beside being a successful actor, his personal life is heartbreaking because of the loss of his wife and daughter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And I really respect him after I read about his quote "I'm at the stage of my life where I keep myself out of any arguments, even if you tell me 1 + 1 = 5 then you are absolutely correct". This quote shaped my thinking about how to response other people opinions about my life. Also, I believe that he has made many charity donations without announcing the exect amount, because he doesn't need to. He has no scandals at all. And that is it - he is my number one actor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Ideas</strong>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- Start with full name, nationality, and basic background</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Keanu Reeves</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Canadian</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Born in Lebanon and grew up in Cananda</p>\n<p>- Mention about first film or first impress</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Matrix in 1999</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Calm but powerful performance</p>\n<p>- Acting style</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ quite character, strong character</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ acting natural</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ humble&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ real and emotional</p>\n<p>- Typical roles</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ main character/stars in</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ romantic, dramatic roles</p>\n<p>- List some popular movies:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ The Matrix in 1999 which is a science fiction movie about the dystopian future</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ John Wick series about a man revenge who kill hist dog</p>\n<p>- Personality and background where I like about the actor:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Charity but not showing off</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Treats people kindly</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Humble, down-to-earth</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Tragic past about the loss of his family</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Life philosophy, quote...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Phrases:</p>\n<p>- To begin with, I like his acting.</p>\n<p>- Another reason why I like him is the humble and humor personality</p>\n<p>- What's more that he is not showing off about his charity donations</p>\n<p>- Apart from his acting, I admire his point of view about life</p>\n<p>- I was amazed by the actions that he performed.</p>\n<p>- I really admire how he ...</p>\n<p>- I find him very inspiring because ...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n
