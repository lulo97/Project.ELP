202509271131261949	Let's start off by talking about work and studies. What are you doing right now?	Currently I just graduated, so I'm in between things. But yeah, I am finding work at this point. Ideally in Mumbai. I'm really interested in the startup industry—there are some startups that I'm looking to work with right now. So that's just what this next chapter holds for me.
202509290254579897	Where is your hometown?	My hometown's in Hanoi, which is the capital city of Vietnam. It's located in the north of the country, not really that far from the southern Chinese border.
202510070006163052	What do you think about the phenomenon of people waiting hours before restaurant to get a meal?	I think the restaurant must be really good, or it's just their advertising is doing really well. And my next step is to reach out some of my close friends and invite them to go to that restaurant next week.
202510210536469368	What is the most popular tourist attraction in your country.	Vietnam, which is my country, is famous for delicious dishes like pho and banh mi, as well as attractive landscape like beaches in Da Nang city.
