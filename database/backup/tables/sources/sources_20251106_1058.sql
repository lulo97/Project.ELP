202509190028279532	Open your eyes in sea water and it is difficult to see much more than a murky, bleary green colour. Sounds, too, are garbled and difficult to comprehend. Without specialised equipment humans would be lost in these deep sea habitats, so how do fish make it seem so easy? Much of this is due to a biological phenomenon known as electroreception – the ability to perceive and act upon electrical stimuli as part of the overall senses. This ability is only found in aquatic or amphibious species because water is an efficient conductor of electricity.\n\nElectroreception comes in two variants. While all animals (including humans) generate electric signals, because they are emitted by the nervous system, some animals have the ability – known as passive electroreception – to receive and decode electric signals generated by other animals in order to sense their location.\n\nOther creatures can go further still, however. Animals with active electroreception possess bodily organs that generate special electric signals on cue. These can be used for mating signals and territorial displays as well as locating objects in the water. Active electroreceptors can differentiate between the various resistances that their electrical currents encounter. This can help them identify whether another creature is prey, predator or something that is best left alone. Active electroreception has a range of about one body length – usually just enough to give its host time to get out of the way or go in for the kill.\n\nOne fascinating use of active electroreception – known as the Jamming Avoidance Response mechanism – has been observed between members of some species known as the weakly electric fish. When two such electric fish meet in the ocean using the same frequency, each fish will then shift the frequency of its discharge so that they are transmitting on different frequencies. Doing so prevents their electroreception faculties from becoming jammed. Long before citizens’ band radio users first had to yell “Get off my frequency!” at hapless novices cluttering the air waves, at least one species had found a way to peacefully and quickly resolve this type of dispute.\n\nElectroreception can also play an important role in animal defences. Rays are one such example. Young ray embryos develop inside egg cases that are attached to the sea bed. The embryos keep their tails in constant motion so as to pump water and allow them to breathe through the egg’s casing. If the embryo’s electroreceptors detect the presence of a predatory fish in the vicinity, however, the embryo stops moving (and in so doing ceases transmitting electric currents) until the fish has moved on. Because marine life of various types is often travelling past, the embryo has evolved only to react to signals that are characteristic of the respiratory movements of potential predators such as sharks.\n\nMany people fear swimming in the ocean because of sharks. In some respects, this concern is well grounded – humans are poorly equipped when it comes to electroreceptive defence mechanisms.  Sharks, meanwhile, hunt with extraordinary precision. They initially lock onto their prey through a keen sense of smell (two thirds of a shark’s brain is devoted entirely to its olfactory organs). As the shark reaches proximity to its prey, it tunes into electric signals that ensure a precise strike on its target; this sense is so strong that the shark even attacks blind by letting its eyes recede for protection.\n\nNormally, when humans are attacked it is purely by accident. Since sharks cannot detect from electroreception whether or not something will satisfy their tastes, they tend to “try before they buy”, taking one or two bites and then assessing the results (our sinewy muscle does not compare well with plumper, softer prey such as seals). Repeat attacks are highly likely once a human is bleeding, however; the force of the electric field is heightened by salt in the blood which creates the perfect setting for a feeding frenzy.  In areas where shark attacks on humans are likely to occur, scientists are exploring ways to create artificial electroreceptors that would disorient the sharks and repel them from swimming beaches.\n\nThere is much that we do not yet know concerning how electroreception functions. Although researchers have documented how electroreception alters hunting, defence and communication systems through observation, the exact neurological processes that encode and decode this information are unclear. Scientists are also exploring the role electroreception plays in navigation. Some have proposed that salt water and magnetic fields from the Earth’s core may interact to form electrical currents that sharks use for migratory purposes.	https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/take-ielts/prepare/free-ielts-english-practice-tests/reading-academic/section-1
202509210126312385	Fair games?\n\nFor seventeen days every four years the world is briefly arrested by the captivating, dizzying spectacle of athleticism, ambition, pride and celebration on display at the Summer Olympic Games. After the last weary spectators and competitors have returned home, however, host cities are often left awash in high debts and costly infrastructure maintenance. The staggering expenses involved in a successful Olympic bid are often assumed to be easily mitigated by tourist revenues and an increase in local employment, but more often than not host cities are short changed and their taxpayers for generations to come are left settling the debt.\n\nOlympic extravagances begin with the application process. Bidding alone will set most cities back about $20 million, and while officially bidding only takes two years (for cities that make the shortlist), most cities can expect to exhaust a decade working on their bid from the moment it is initiated to the announcement of voting results from International Olympic Committee members. Aside from the financial costs of the bid alone, the process ties up real estate in prized urban locations until the outcome is known. This can cost local economies millions of dollars of lost revenue from private developers who could have made use of the land, and can also mean that particular urban quarters lose their vitality due to the vacant lots. All of this can be for nothing if a bidding city does not appease the whims of IOC members – private connections and opinions on government conduct often hold sway (Chicago’s 2012 bid is thought to have been undercut by tensions over U.S. foreign policy).   \n\nBidding costs do not compare, however, to the exorbitant bills that come with hosting the Olympic Games themselves. As is typical with large-scale, one-off projects, budgeting for the Olympics is a notoriously formidable task. Los Angelinos have only recently finished paying off their budget-breaking 1984 Olympics; Montreal is still in debt for its 1976 Games (to add insult to injury, Canada is the only host country to have failed to win a single gold medal during its own Olympics). The tradition of runaway expenses has persisted in recent years. London Olympics managers have admitted that their 2012 costs may increase ten times over their initial projections, leaving tax payers 20 billion pounds in the red.  \n\nHosting the Olympics is often understood to be an excellent way to update a city’s sporting infrastructure. The extensive demands of Olympic sports include aquatic complexes, equestrian circuits, shooting ranges, beach volleyball courts, and, of course, an 80,000 seat athletic stadium. Yet these demands are typically only necessary to accommodate a brief influx of athletes from around the world. Despite the enthusiasm many populations initially have for the development of world-class sporting complexes in their home towns, these complexes typically fall into disuse after the Olympic fervour has waned. Even Australia, home to one of the world’s most sportive populations, has left its taxpayers footing a $32 million-a-year bill for the maintenance of vacant facilities.\n\nAnother major concern is that when civic infrastructure developments are undertaken in preparation for hosting the Olympics, these benefits accrue to a single metropolitan centre (with the exception of some outlying areas that may get some revamped sports facilities). In countries with an expansive land mass, this means vast swathes of the population miss out entirely. Furthermore, since the International Olympic Committee favours prosperous “global” centres (the United Kingdom was told, after three failed bids from its provincial cities, that only London stood any real chance at winning), the improvement of public transport, roads and communication links tends to concentrate in places already well-equipped with world-class infrastructures. Perpetually by-passing minor cities creates a cycle of disenfranchisement: these cities never get an injection of capital, they fail to become first-rate candidates, and they are constantly passed over in favour of more secure choices.  \n\nFinally, there is no guarantee that an Olympics will be a popular success. The “feel good” factor that most proponents of Olympic bids extol (and that was no doubt driving the 90 to 100 per cent approval rates of Parisians and Londoners for their cities’ respective 2012 bids) can be an elusive phenomenon, and one that is tied to that nation’s standing on the medal tables. This ephemeral thrill cannot compare to the years of disruptive construction projects and security fears that go into preparing for an Olympic Games, nor the decades of debt repayment that follow (Greece’s preparation for Athens 2004 famously deterred tourists from visiting the country due to widespread unease about congestion and disruption). \n\nThere are feasible alternatives to the bloat, extravagance and wasteful spending that comes with a modern Olympic Games. One option is to designate a permanent host city that would be re-designed or built from scratch especially for the task. Another is to extend the duration of the Olympics so that it becomes a festival of several months. Local businesses would enjoy the extra spending and congestion would ease substantially as competitors and spectators come and go according to their specific interests. Neither the “Olympic City” nor the extended length options really get to the heart of the issue, however. Stripping away ritual and decorum in favour of concentrating on athletic rivalry would be preferable.\n\nFailing that, the Olympics could simply be scrapped altogether. International competition could still be maintained through world championships in each discipline. Most of these events are already held on non-Olympic years anyway – the International Association of Athletics Federations, for example, has run a biennial World Athletics Championship since 1983 after members decided that using the Olympics for their championship was no longer sufficient. Events of this nature keep world-class competition alive without requiring Olympic-sized expenses. 	https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/take-ielts/prepare/free-ielts-english-practice-tests/reading-academic/section-2
202509261859135652	Sustainable Architecture – Lessons from the Ant\n\nAfrica owes a lot to its termite mounds. Trees and shrubs take root in them. Prospectors mine them, searching for specks of gold carried up by termites from hundreds of metres below. And of course, they are a special treat for aardvarks and other insectivores. Now, Africa is paying an offbeat tribute to these towers of mud. The extraordinary Eastgate Building in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city, is said to be the only one in the world to use the same cooling and heating principles as the termite mound.\n\nTermites in Zimbabwe build gigantic mounds inside which they farm a fungus that is their primary food source. This must be kept at exactly 30.5 °C, while the temperatures on the African veld outside can range from just above freezing at 1.5 °C at night to a baking 40 °C during the day. The termites achieve this remarkable feat by building a system of vents in the mound. Those at the base lead down into chambers cooled by wet mud carried up from water tables far below, and others lead up through a flue to the peak of the mound. By constantly opening and closing these heating and cooling vents throughout the day, the termites succeed in keeping the temperature constant despite the wide fluctuations outside.\n\nArchitect Mick Pearce used precisely the same strategy when designing the Eastgate Building, which has no air conditioning and virtually no heating. The country’s largest commercial and shopping complex uses less than 10% of the energy of a conventional building its size. These efficiencies translated directly to the bottom line: the Eastgate’s owners saved $3.5 million on a $36 million building because an air-conditioning plant didn’t have to be imported. These savings were also passed on to tenants: rents are 20% lower than in a new building next door. The complex is actually two buildings linked by bridges across a shady, glass-roofed atrium open to the breezes. Fans draw fresh air in from the atrium, blow it upstairs through hollow spaces under the floors, and from there into each office through baseboard vents. As it rises and warms, it is drawn out via ceiling vents and finally exits through forty-eight brick chimneys. To keep the harsh highveld sun from heating the interior, no more than 25% of the exterior is glass, and all the windows are shaded by cement arches that jut out more than a metre.\n\nDuring summer’s cool nights, large fans flush air through the building seven times an hour to chill the hollow floors. By day, smaller fans blow two changes of air an hour through the building, circulating the air that has been cooled by contact with the floors. For winter days, there are small heaters in the vents. This is all possible only because Harare is 1,600 metres above sea level, has cloudless skies, little humidity, and rapid temperature swings—days as warm as 31 °C commonly drop to 14 °C at night. “You couldn’t do this in New York, with its fantastically hot summers and fantastically cold winters,” Pearce said. Then his eyes lit up at the challenge: “Perhaps you could store the summer’s heat in water somehow.”\n\nThe engineering firm Ove Arup & Partners, which worked with him on the design, monitors daily temperatures outside, under the floors, and at knee, desk, and ceiling level. Their graphs show that the building’s temperature has generally stayed between 23 °C and 25 °C, with the exception of the annual hot spell just before the summer rains in October, and three days in November when a janitor accidentally switched off the fans at night. The atrium, which funnels the winds through, can be much cooler. And the air is far fresher than in air-conditioned buildings, where up to 30% of the air is recycled.\n\nPearce, disdaining smooth glass skins as “igloos in the Sahara,” calls his building, with its exposed girders and pipes, “spiky.” The design of the entrances is based on the porcupine-quill headdresses of the local Shona tribe. Elevators are designed to look like the mineshaft cages used in Zimbabwe’s diamond mines. The shape of the fan covers, and the stone used in their construction, echo Great Zimbabwe, the ruins that give the country its name. Standing on a roof catwalk, peering down inside at people as small as termites below, Pearce said he hoped plants would grow wild in the atrium and pigeons and bats would move into it like the termites’ fungus, further extending the whole “organic machine” metaphor. The architecture, he says, is a regionalised style that responds to the biosphere, to the ancient stone architecture of Zimbabwe’s past, and to local human resources.	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5rY0aW73aErrrialUyeLpuGc5_uIxLJ/view
202509301302581604	Make That Wine!\n\nAustralia is a nation of beer drinkers. Actually, make that wine. Yes, wine has now just about supplanted beer as the alcoholic drink of choice, probably because of the extensive range of choices available and the rich culture behind them. This all adds a certain depth and intimacy to the drinking process which beer just cannot match. In addition, although wine drinkers seldom think about it, moderate consumption seems to be beneficial for the health, lowering the incidence of heart disease and various other ailments.\n\nWine is the product of the fermentation of grape juice, in which yeast (a fungus) consumes the natural sugars within, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide as waste. Yeast grows naturally on many varieties of grapes, often visible as a white powder, and causing fermentation directly on the plant. Thus, the discovery of wine-making was inevitable at some stage in human history. The evidence shows that this was at least 8,000 years ago in the Near East. From there, wine-making spread around the ancient Mediterranean civilisations, where the liquid was extensively produced, drunk, and traded. To this day, the biggest drinkers of wine remain the Mediterranean countries, with France leading the way.\n\nThis leads to the classification of wines, which is quite complex. It often begins with the colour: red or white. Most people do not know that the colour of wine is not due to the grapes used (whose skins are either green or purple), but to the wine-making process itself. All grape juice is clear. Red wines are produced by leaving the grape skin in contact with the juice during fermentation; white wines by not doing so. Thus, white wine can be made from dark-coloured grapes, provided that the skin is separated early, although the resultant wine may have a pinkish tinge.\n\nA similar wine classification is based more specifically on the grape species used, giving such well-known names as Pinot Noir and Merlot. Chardonnay grapes remain one of the most widely planted, producing an array of white wines, rivaling the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, a key ingredient in the world’s most widely recognised, and similarly named, red wines. When one grape species is used, or is predominant, the wine produced is called varietal, as opposed to mixing the juices of various identified grapes, which results in blended wines. The latter process is often done when wine-makers, and the people who drink their product, want a consistent taste year after year. Far from being looked down upon, it often results in some of the world’s most expensive bottles, such as the Côte-Rôtie wines in France.\n\nIncreasingly, however, market recognition is based on the location of the wine production, resulting in labels such as Bordeaux in France, Napa Valley in California, and the Barossa Valley in Australia. Traditional wines made in these places carry trademarks, respected by serious wine drinkers. However, an example of the blurred lines is the term ‘champagne’. This was once expected to be made from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France, with all the expertise and traditions of that area, but, despite legal attempts to trademark the term, it has become ‘semi-generic’, allowing it to be used for any wine of this type made anywhere in the world.\n\nFinally, we come to the vinification method as a means of classification. One example is, in fact, champagne, known as a ‘sparkling’ wine. By allowing a secondary fermentation in a sealed container, it retains some of the waste carbon dioxide. Another variation is to stop the fermentation before all the natural sugars are consumed, creating dessert wines, ranging from slight to extreme sweetness. Yet again, grapes can be harvested well beyond their maximum ripeness, creating ‘late harvest wines’, or allowed to become partially dried (or ‘raisin-ed’), creating ‘dried grape wines’. Clearly, there are many possibilities, all producing uniquely flavoured products.\n\nOne of the best-known terms relating to wine is ‘vintage’. This signifies that the product was made from grapes that were grown in a single labeled year. If that year is eventually acknowledged to have produced exceptionally fine grapes and resultant wines (‘a good vintage’), bottles from that period are often saved for future consumption. Of course, the appreciation and assessment of wine is an inexact science, meaning that the significance of a particular vintage often promotes much speculation and disagreement. A non-vintage wine is usually a blend from the produce of two or more years, which is done, as mentioned before, for consistency and quality control.\n\nThis leads to the rich and varied world of wine assessment, and its descriptive terminology. Wine has such a variety of aromas, flavours, textures, and aftertastes that serious wine drinkers demand an agreed vocabulary so that the drinking sensations can be reliably described in writing. From bouquet to biscuity, mellow to musky, vivid to vegetal, the conceited connoisseur can perplex the listener with some really purple prose. Perhaps the opportunity to posture pretentiously with all this jargon is the main reason why wine enthusiasts are so taken with this product.

202510020953166986	Australian Artist Margaret Preston\n\nMargaret Preston's vibrant paintings and prints of Australian flowers, animals, and landscapes have delighted the Australian public since the early 1920s.\n\nMargaret Preston was born Margaret Rose McPherson in Port Adelaide, South Australia, in 1875, the daughter of David McPherson, a Scottish marine engineer, and his wife, Prudence Lyle. She and her sister were first sent to a private school, but when family circumstances changed, their mother took the girls to Sydney, where Margaret attended a public high school. She decided early in life to become an artist and took private art lessons. In 1888, she trained for several months with Sydney landscape painter William Lister, and in 1893 enrolled at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, where she studied for just over four years.\n\nIn 1898, after her father died, Margaret returned to Adelaide to study and then teach at the Adelaide School of Design. Her early artwork was influenced by the German aesthetic tradition, in which subjects of the natural world were depicted in a true-to-life manner.\n\nMargaret's first visit to Europe in 1904, and her studies in Paris, France, had little impact on the naturalism that dominated her work in this early period. However, some eight years later, after returning to Paris, she began to recognize the decorative possibilities of art.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, Margaret traveled to England, where she held exhibitions and continued her studies of art. She studied pottery but soon developed her interest in various techniques of printmaking and design. In England's West Country, she taught basket weaving at a rehabilitation unit for servicemen. It was on board a ship returning to Australia that she met wealthy businessman William Preston, whom she married in 1919. Together, Margaret and William settled in the Sydney harbourside suburb of Mosman. The most characteristic prints from her early years in Sydney are views of boats floating on Sydney Harbour and of houses clustered on foreshore hills. Although Sydney was their home, the couple traveled regularly, both overseas and within Australia.\n\nHer first major showing in Australia was with her friend Thea Proctor, in exhibitions in Melbourne and Sydney in 1925. Many of Preston's prints were hand-coloured in rich scarlet reds, blues, and greens, and all of them were set in Chinese red lacquer frames. Harbour views were again prominent, but compared with earlier artworks, they were compact and busy, using striking contrasts of black and white combined with elaborate patterns and repetitions. Other prints from this period featured native flora. With these still-life subjects, she convinced the public that Australian native flowers were equal in beauty to any exotic species.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1939, Preston moved away from Sydney and lived with her husband at Berowra, on the upper reaches of the Hawkesbury River. The area was one of rugged natural beauty, and for the first time Preston found herself living in a home surrounded by bushland. Prior to this, the native flowers that featured in her paintings and prints had been purchased from local florists; now they grew in abundance around her home. Preston's prints became larger, less complex, and less reliant on the use of bright colours. Flowers were no longer arranged in vases, and Preston began to concentrate instead on flowers growing wild.\n\nWhile living at Berowra, and undoubtedly prompted by the Aboriginal rock engravings found near her property, Preston also developed what was to be a lifelong interest in Aboriginal art. On returning to Sydney in 1939, she became a member of the Anthropological Society of New South Wales and later visited many important Aboriginal sites throughout Australia. Preston believed that Aboriginal art provided the key to establishing a national body of art that reflected the vast and ancient continent of Australia.\n\nDuring the 1940s, symbols used by Aboriginal people, together with the dried, earthy colours found in traditional Aboriginal paintings, became increasingly prominent in her prints. The artist's titles from this period frequently acknowledged her sources and revealed the extent to which she drew inspiration from traditional Aboriginal art to create her own.\n\nIn 1953, at the age of 78, Preston produced her most significant prints. The exhibition at Macquarie Galleries in Sydney included 29 prints made using the ancient technique known as stenciling. Many of the artworks in the exhibition incorporated her fusion of Aboriginal and Chinese concepts. Preston had admired Chinese art since 1915, when she acquired the first of her many books on the subject, and she had visited China on two occasions. Chinese elements may also be found in several of her earlier paintings.\n\nHowever, in her prints of the 1950s, Preston combined Chinese ideas with her understanding of the Dreamtime creation stories of Aboriginal Australians. Preston did not let age alter her habit of working hard. As she grew older, her love of painting, printmaking, and travel continued. By the time of her death in 1963, at the age of 88, she had produced over 400 paintings and prints. In a career spanning almost 60 years, she created a body of work that demonstrates her extraordinary originality and the intensity of her commitment to Australian art.	https://mini-ielts.com/1518/reading/australian-artist-margaret-preston
202510050720162508	The law influences all of us virtually all the time. It governs almost every aspect of our behavior — even what happens to us after we are no longer alive. It affects us from the embryo onwards. It governs the air we breathe, the food and drink we consume, our travel, family relationships, and our property. It applies at the bottom of the ocean and even in space.\n\nEach time we examine a label on a food product, engage in work as an employee or employer, travel on the roads, go to school to learn or to teach, stay in a hotel, borrow a library book, create or dissolve a commercial company, play sports, or engage the services of someone for anything from plumbing a sink to planning a city — we are in the world of law.\n\nLaw has also become much more widely recognized as the standard by which behavior is judged. A very telling development in recent history is the way in which the idea of law has permeated all parts of social life. The universal standard of whether something is socially tolerated is increasingly becoming whether it is legal, rather than whether it has traditionally been considered acceptable.\n\nIn earlier times, most people were illiterate. Today, by contrast, a vast number of people can read, and it is becoming easier for people to take an interest in law and for the general population to help shape the law in many countries. However, law is a versatile instrument that can be used equally well for the improvement or the degradation of humanity.\n\nThis, of course, puts law in a very significant position. In our rapidly developing world, all sorts of skills and knowledge are valuable. Those people, for example, with expertise in computers, the internet, and communications technology are relied upon by the rest of us.\n\nThere is now someone with IT skills or an IT help desk in every UK school, every company, every hospital, and every local and central government office. Without their knowledge, many parts of commercial and social life today would seize up within minutes. But legal understanding is just as vital and universally needed.\n\nThe American comedian Jerry Seinfeld put it like this: “We are all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there is a problem, the lawyer is the only person who has read the inside of the top of the box.” In other words, the lawyer is the only person who has read and made sense of the rules.\n\nThe number of laws has never been greater. In the UK alone, about 35 new Acts of Parliament are produced every year, thereby introducing thousands of new rules. The legislative output of the British Parliament has more than doubled in recent times — from about 1,100 pages a year in the early 1970s to over 2,500 pages a year today. Between 1997 and 2006, the legislature passed 365 Acts of Parliament and more than 32,000 legally binding statutory instruments.\n\nIn a system with so much law, lawyers do a great deal not only to vindicate the rights of citizens and organizations but also to help develop the law through legal arguments — some of which are adopted by judges and become law themselves. Law courts can and do produce new law and revise old law, but they do so only after hearing the arguments of lawyers.\n\nHowever, despite their important role in developing the rules, lawyers are not universally admired. Anti-lawyer jokes have a long history, going back to the ancient Greeks.\n\nMore recently, the son of a famous Hollywood actor was asked at his junior school what his father did for a living. He replied, “My daddy is a movie actor, and sometimes he plays the good guy, and sometimes he plays the lawyer.”\n\nFor balance, though, it is worth remembering that there have been many heroic and revered lawyers, such as the Roman philosopher and politician Cicero, and Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian campaigner for independence.\n\nPeople sometimes make comments that characterize lawyers as professionals whose concerns place personal reward above truth, or who gain financially from misfortune. There are undoubtedly lawyers who fit that description — just as there are scientists, journalists, and others who might. But, in general, it is no more just to say that lawyers are bad because they make a living from people’s problems than it is to make the same accusation against nurses or IT consultants.\n\nA great many lawyers are involved in public law work, such as that involving civil liberties, housing, and other social issues. Such work is not lavishly remunerated, and the quality of service provided by these lawyers relies on considerable professional dedication. Moreover, much legal work has nothing to do with conflict or misfortune but is primarily concerned with drafting documents.\n\nAnother source of public dissatisfaction with lawyers — and with the law itself — is a limited public understanding of how law works and how it can be changed. Greater clarity about these issues, perhaps through better public education and communication, would reduce many aspects of public dissatisfaction with the law.	The Importance of Law
202510071322538277	The numerous small islands of the Pacific Ocean were uninhabited until the ancestors of today’s islanders sailed from Southeast Asia in ocean-going canoes approximately 2,000 years ago. Even today, debate continues over how they managed to migrate such vast distances across the ocean without the benefit of the modern navigational technologies we take for granted.\n\nAlthough early twentieth-century writers often portrayed fleets of heroic navigators simultaneously setting sail in romanticized accounts, later scholars came to view these depictions as exaggerated. A more considered assessment of Pacific voyaging did not appear until 1956, when the American historian Andrew Sharp published his research. Sharp challenged the “heroic vision” by asserting that navigational expertise among Pacific peoples was limited and that island settlement occurred largely by chance, through drifting canoes rather than systematic voyaging. His theory, though influential, was widely and rightly criticized. Nevertheless, it reignited interest in the subject and inspired valuable new research.\n\nSince the 1960s, a wealth of investigations has been carried out—most of them refreshingly not of the “armchair” variety. While it would be unfair to dismiss all “armchair” research (that based solely on existing publications), little progress had previously been made because most writers relied on outdated sources such as travelers’ journals and missionary accounts written by untrained observers. Following Sharp’s publication, this began to change as researchers increasingly conducted fieldwork rather than library-based studies.\n\nIn 1965, David Lewis, a physician and experienced yachtsman, adopted a unique approach. Using his own yacht, he navigated through the Pacific islands to meet men who still practiced traditional navigation. He then joined them on test voyages in their canoes, during which all modern instruments were hidden from sight—though Lewis secretly used them to verify the navigators’ accuracy. His most famous expedition was a round trip of about 1,000 nautical miles between two mid-ocean islands. Contrary to Sharp’s drift theory, Lewis found that traditional navigators steered deliberate courses by memorizing which stars rose and set at specific points on the horizon, thus giving them fixed directional guides.\n\nThe geographer Edwin Doran took a different approach. Interested in the precise sailing performance of canoes, he used advanced electronic instruments to collect data on their speeds under various wind conditions—from gales to calms—and their ability to sail at different angles to the wind. His research, conducted aboard traditional sailing canoes in some of the most remote parts of the Pacific, produced the first accurate measurements of their capabilities.\n\nA further contribution came from Steven Horvath, a physiologist. His focus was not on navigation or canoe design but on the physical endurance of the sailors themselves. By adapting standard physiological techniques, Horvath calculated the energy expenditure required to paddle such canoes when the wind failed or was unfavorable. He concluded that paddles—or possibly long oars—could indeed propel these primarily sailing vessels over long distances.\n\nFinally, a team led by P. Wall Garrard made an important contribution through laboratory-based research. Garrard’s innovative method involved using linguistic findings that showed remarkable similarities among Pacific island languages, even when the islands were thousands of kilometers apart. By adapting computer simulation techniques developed in other disciplines, he produced convincing models indicating that Pacific migrations were systematic but not simultaneous. Garrard proposed that migration occurred not as one grand voyage by a massive fleet, but as a series of increasingly ambitious journeys, each pushing further into the unknown.\n\nWhat, then, do we learn about Pacific navigation and voyaging from this research? Importantly, none of the investigators sought to prove a single theory; such experiments cannot definitively confirm or refute hypotheses. The strength of this body of work lies in its diversity of methods. Taken together, the findings suggest that traditional navigators employed various canoe types, sources of water, and navigational techniques—and that their greatest achievement was adaptability. They observed and responded to the conditions at sea, adjusting their methods accordingly. Far from drifting aimlessly, their voyages were most likely part of a systematic pattern of migration. In this way, Pacific peoples came to see the ocean not as a barrier but as a pathway for communication—long before any other culture on Earth.\n\nOne unexpected but welcome outcome of this research has been a renaissance in traditional voyaging. In several Pacific island groups today, young people are reviving the ancient skills of their ancestors—skills that, only a few decades ago, seemed destined to disappear forever.

202510080952486264	The 16th and 17th centuries witnessed two great pioneers of modern science: Galileo and Gilbert. The impact of their discoveries is immense. Gilbert was the first modern scientist and is regarded as the father of the science of electricity and magnetism. He was an English scholar and physician at the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Before him, knowledge of electricity and magnetism was limited to what the ancients knew — namely, that lodestones possessed magnetic properties and that amber or jet, when rubbed, could attract small, lightweight objects. However, Gilbert is less well known than he deserves to be.\n\nGilbert was born before Galileo. He came from a distinguished local family in Colchester, England, and was born on May 24, 1544. He attended grammar school and later studied medicine at St John’s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1573. Afterwards, he travelled across the continent and eventually settled in London.\n\nHe became a highly successful and respected physician. His achievements culminated in his election as President of the Royal Science Society. He was also appointed personal physician to Queen Elizabeth I and was later knighted by her. Gilbert faithfully served the Queen until her death. However, he did not outlive her for long; he died on November 30, 1603, only a few months after being appointed personal physician to King James I.\n\nGilbert was initially interested in chemistry but later shifted his focus due to the excessive mysticism associated with alchemy — such as the supposed transmutation of metals. He gradually developed an interest in physics, particularly inspired by the ancient Greeks’ knowledge of lodestones, strange minerals that could attract iron.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1588, Britain became a major seafaring nation after defeating the Spanish Armada, paving the way for British settlement in America. British ships relied heavily on the magnetic compass, yet no one understood how it worked. Did the Pole Star attract it, as Columbus once speculated? Or was there, as described in the Odyssey, a magnetic mountain at the pole that ships dared not approach for fear that its pull would strip away their iron nails and fittings?\n\nFor nearly twenty years, William Gilbert conducted ingenious experiments to understand magnetism. His most famous work is On the Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet of the Earth.\n\nGilbert’s discoveries were of immense importance to modern physics. He investigated the nature of magnetism and electricity and even coined the term “electric.”\n\nIn earlier times, magnetism was surrounded by superstition — for instance, sailors believed that rubbing garlic on a lodestone could neutralize its magnetism, or that even the smell of garlic could interfere with a compass. For this reason, helmsmen were forbidden to eat garlic near the ship’s compass.\n\nGilbert also found that metals could be magnetized by rubbing materials such as fur or cloth against them. He named the ends of a magnet the “north pole” and “south pole.” The magnetic poles attract or repel one another depending on their polarity, while ordinary iron is always attracted to a magnet.\n\nAlthough he began to study the relationship between magnetism and electricity, he did not complete this work. His experiments with static electricity using amber and jet demonstrated that electrically charged objects could attract small, lightweight materials. It was the French scientist Charles du Fay who later discovered that there are actually two types of electric charge — positive and negative.\n\nGilbert also questioned traditional astronomical beliefs. Although a supporter of Copernicus, he never explicitly stated whether he believed the Earth was at the center of the universe or in orbit around the Sun. He did, however, believe that the stars were not equidistant from Earth but had their own Earth-like planets orbiting them.\n\nHe proposed that the Earth itself acts as a giant magnet, explaining why compasses always point north. The Earth spins on an axis aligned with its magnetic polarity. Gilbert compared the polarity of a magnet to that of the Earth and built an entire magnetic philosophy around this analogy. In his view, magnetism was the “soul of the Earth.”\n\nHe believed that a perfectly spherical lodestone, when aligned with the Earth’s poles, would rotate on its own every 24 hours. Furthermore, he speculated that the Sun and other stars might rotate around crystalline cores, and that the Moon’s orbit could be caused by magnetic attraction to the Earth. This was perhaps the first suggestion that a force might govern the motion of heavenly bodies.\n\nGilbert’s research methods were revolutionary because he relied on experiments rather than pure logic and reasoning, as the ancient Greek philosophers had done. This marked a new attitude toward scientific investigation. Until then, experimentation had not been a central part of scientific inquiry.\n\nIt was thanks to this experimental spirit, along with his contributions to the study of magnetism, that a unit of magnetomotive force — also known as magnetic potential — was later named the gilbert in his honor. His commitment to observation and experimentation, rather than reliance on authority or deduction alone, laid the very foundations of modern science.	William Gilbert and Magnetism
202510181514517591	Graziers view them as pests, and poisoning is common, but some biologists believe Australia’s dingoes are the best weapon in the fight against imported cats and foxes.\n\nA plane flies a slow pattern over Carlton Hill station, a 3,600-square-kilometre ranch in the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. As it circles, the occupants drop 1,000 small pieces of meat, one by one, onto the scrubland below. Each piece is laced with poison in a practice known as baiting. Home to 50,000 head of cattle, Carlton Hill is also the territory of the dingo, Australia’s largest mammalian predator and the bane of a grazier's (cattle farmer's) life. Stuart McKechnie, the station's manager, complains that dingoes preying on cattle threatens graziers’ livelihoods. However, one man wants the baiting to end and for dingoes to once again roam Australia’s wide-open spaces. According to Chris Johnson of James Cook University, "Australia needs more dingoes to protect our biodiversity."\n\nAbout 4,000 years ago, Asian sailors introduced dingoes to Australia. Over the ensuing millennia, these wolf descendants spread across the continent. As the Tasmanian tiger disappeared, dingoes became Australia's top predators. With European agricultural development, settlers found they could not safely keep livestock where dingoes roamed. This initiated one of the most sustained pest control efforts in Australia’s history. For the last 150 years, dingoes have been shot, poisoned, and kept at bay by fences. Ironically, while settlers tried to eliminate this native pest, they introduced others.\n\nIn 1860, a wealthy landowner unleashed rabbits in Australia; by 1980, they had spread across most of the mainland. The rabbits provided a huge prey base for two other introduced species: the feral cat and the red fox. The interaction between foxes, cats, and rabbits creates a severe problem for native mammals. In good years, rabbit populations boom, allowing fox and cat numbers to surge. When conditions deteriorate, rabbit numbers crash, leaving the large populations of foxes and cats with little to eat except native mammals.\n\nAustralian mammals generally reproduce much more slowly than rabbits, cats, and foxes—an adaptation to prevent overpopulation in an arid environment where food is often scarce and unreliable. Consequently, their populations decline because they cannot replace animals killed by predators quickly enough. Johnson argues that dingoes are the solution, as they keep cat and fox populations under control. Besides regularly preying on the smaller predators, dingoes will kill them simply to reduce competition. Dingo packs live in large, stable territories and typically have only one breeding female, which naturally limits their population growth. In the 4,000 years dingoes have been in Australia, Johnson notes, they have contributed to few, if any, extinctions.\n\nStretching from the coast in Queensland to the Great Australian Bight in South Australia is the world’s longest fence—a two-metre-high barrier running 5,300 km from a desolate spot where three states meet. This fence is designed to keep dingoes out of the southeast and separates Australia's main livestock types. To the northwest, cattle predominate; to the southeast, sheep fill the landscape. In fact, Australia is a land dominated by these animals, with 25 million cattle and 100 million sheep, compared to just over 20 million people.\n\nWhile dingoes will prey on sheep given the chance, McKechnie states they do not hunt cattle once the calves are more than two or three weeks old. A Queensland study co-authored by Lee Allen of the Robert Wicks Research Centre suggests that dingoes do not even heavily prey on newborn calves unless their staple prey disappears due to deteriorating conditions like drought. This study indicates that aggressive baiting programs may be counter-productive for graziers. When dingoes are removed from an area, it is recolonized by younger, more solitary animals. These dingoes are less capable of hunting large prey like kangaroos and instead turn to calves. The study found some of the highest rates of calf predation occurred in areas that had been baited.\n\nMark Clifford, general manager of a firm that manages over 200,000 head of cattle, is not convinced by Allen’s assertion. "It's obvious if we drop or loosen control on dingoes, we are going to lose more calves," Clifford says. He does not believe dingoes would choose kangaroos over readily available calves, nor is he persuaded of their ecological benefits. He doubts dingoes catch cats often, believing they are more likely to prey on small native animals.\n\nMcKechnie acknowledges that dingoes kill wallabies (small native animals) that compete with his cattle for food. However, he points out that in parts of Western Australia, there are no foxes and very few cats, so he doesn't see how relaxing dingo controls would improve the local ecological balance. Johnson sees a need for a philosophical shift among graziers. "There might be a number of different ways of thinking through dingo management in cattle country," he says. "At the moment, though, that hasn’t gotten through to graziers. There's still just one prescription, and that is to bait as widely as possible."	The dingo debate
202510192152416581	A. Parrots are found across the tropics and on all southern hemisphere continents except Antarctica, but nowhere do they display such a richness of diversity and form as in Australia. One-sixth of the world’s 345 parrot species are found there, and Australia has long been renowned for the number and variety of its parrots.\n\nB. In the 16th century, the German cartographer Mercator created a world map that included a place, somewhere near present-day Australia, which he named Terra Psittacorum—the Land of Parrots—and the first European settlers in Australia often referred to the country as Parrot Land. In 1865, the celebrated British naturalist and wildlife artist John Gould said: “No group of birds gives Australia so tropical and benign an air as the numerous species of this great family by which it is tenanted.”\n\nC. Parrots are descendants of an ancient lineage. Due to their great diversity, and since most species inhabit Africa, Australia, and South America, it seems almost certain that parrots originated millions of years ago on the ancient southern continent of Gondwana, before it broke up into the separate southern hemisphere continents we know today. Much of Gondwana comprised vast rainforests intersected by huge, slow-flowing rivers and expansive lakes, but by eight million years ago, great changes were underway. The center of the continent of Australia had begun to dry out, and the rainforests that once covered it gradually contracted to the continental margins, where they still exist, to a limited extent, today.\n\nD. The creatures that remained in those shrinking rainforests had to adapt to the drier conditions or face extinction. In response to these desperate circumstances, the parrot family—typically found in jungles in other parts of the world—populated some of Australia’s harshest environments. The parrots spread from ancestral forests through eucalypt woodlands to colonies in the central deserts of Australia, and as a consequence, they diversified into a wide range of species with adaptations reflecting the many changes animals and plants had to make to survive in these areas.\n\nE. These evolutionary pressures helped mold keratin, the substance from which beaks are made, into a range of tools capable of gathering the new food types favored by various parrot species. The size of a parrot’s short, blunt beak and the curvature of its upper section are related to the type of food each species eats. Some have comparatively long beaks that are perfect for extracting seeds from fruit; others have broader, stronger beaks designed for cracking hard seeds.\n\nF. Differently shaped beaks are not the only adaptations that have developed during the evolving relationship between parrots and their food plants. Like all of Australia’s nectar-feeding birds, the rainbow-colored lorikeets and the flowers on which they feed have long co-evolved. Features such as the shape and color of the flowers have adapted to the birds’ particular needs; for example, red is the most attractive color to birds, so flowers that depend on birds for pollination are more often red. Lorikeets’ tongues have bristles that help them collect as much pollen as possible.\n\nG. Today, most of Australia’s parrots inhabit woodland and open forest, and their numbers decline toward both deserts and wetter areas. The majority are nomadic to some degree, moving around to take advantage of feeding and breeding opportunities. Two dry-country parrots—the pink and grey galah and the pink, white, and yellow corella—have expanded their ranges in recent years. They are among the species that have adapted well to the changes brought about by European settlement, which created grasslands where galahs and corellas thrive.\n\nH. Other parrot species, however, did not fare so well when their environments were altered. The clearing of large areas of rainforest is probably responsible for the disappearance of the double-eyed fig parrot, and numbers of ground parrots declined when much of their habitat was destroyed by the draining of coastal swamps. Even some parrot species that initially benefited from forest clearing are now affected by a shortage of nesting sites due to further human-induced changes.\n\nI. New conditions sometimes favor an incoming species over one that originally inhabited the area. For example, after farmers cleared large areas of forest on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, the island was colonized by galahs. They began using tree hollows and destroying black cockatoo eggs to take the hollows for their own use. Their success precipitated a partial collapse in the black cockatoo population, as the latter lost the struggle for scarce nesting sites.\n\nJ. There may be no final answer to ensuring an equitable balance between parrot species. Nest box programs help ease the shortage of nesting sites in some areas, but there are not enough boxes, they are expensive, and they cannot adequately substitute for large, old trees, which provide both habitat and essential resources such as nectar, pollen, and seeds. Competition between parrots for nest sites is a direct result of the changes humans have made to the Earth. We are the most widespread and dangerous competitors that parrots have ever faced, but we also have the knowledge and skill to maintain the wonderfully rich diversity of Australia’s parrots. All we need is the will to do so.	Australian parrots and their adaptation to habitat change
202510220906197438	How and Why We Yawn Still Presents Problems for Researchers in an Area Recently Opened to Study\n\nWhen Robert R. Provine began studying yawning in the 1960s, it was difficult for him to convince research students of the merits of "yawning science." Although it may have appeared quirky to some, Provine's decision to study yawning was a logical extension of his research in developmental neuroscience.\n\nThe verb "to yawn" is derived from the Old English ganien or ginian, meaning "to gape" or "open wide." Beyond gaping jaws, yawning has significant features that are easy to observe and analyze. Provine "collected" yawns for study using a variation of the contagion response. He asked participants to think about yawning and, once they began to yawn, to depress a button that would record the yawn from onset to the end of exhalation.\n\nProvine's early discoveries can be summarized as follows: the yawn is highly stereotyped but not invariant in its duration and form. It is an excellent example of the instinctive "fixed action pattern" studied in classical animal behavior research, or ethology. A yawn is not a reflex—a short-duration, rapid, proportional response to a simple stimulus—but once started, it progresses with the inevitability of a sneeze. The standard yawn lasts about six seconds on average, though its duration can range from roughly three seconds to significantly longer than average. There are no half-yawns, reflecting the intensity typical of fixed action patterns and explaining why yawns cannot easily be stifled. Like a cough, yawns can occur in bouts with highly variable inter-yawn intervals, generally around 68 seconds but rarely exceeding 70. Yawn frequency is independent of duration: individuals producing short or long yawns do not compensate by yawning more or less often. Furthermore, Provine’s hypotheses about the form and function of yawning can be tested using three informative yawn variants, which explore the roles of the nose, mouth, and jaws.\n\ni) The Closed-Nose Yawn\n\nParticipants pinch their noses closed when they feel a yawn coming on. Most report being able to perform normal closed-nose yawns. This indicates that the inhalation at the onset and the exhalation at the end of a yawn need not involve the nostrils, as the mouth provides a sufficient airway.\n\nii) The Clenched-Teeth Yawn\n\nParticipants clench their teeth during a yawn while allowing normal inhalation through open lips and clenched teeth. This creates the sensation of being stuck mid-yawn, showing that jaw gaping is an essential component of the fixed action pattern of yawning. Unless this occurs, the yawn does not run to completion. The experiment also demonstrates that a yawn is more than a deep breath, as inhalation and exhalation are less efficient through clenched teeth than through the nose.\n\niii) The Nose Yawn\n\nThis variant tests whether nasal inhalation alone can sustain a yawn. Unlike normal breathing, which can occur equally well through the mouth or nose, yawning is impossible via nasal inhalation alone. Similar to the clenched-teeth yawn, it produces the sensation of being stuck mid-yawn. Exhalation, however, can be performed equally well through the nose or mouth. Using these methods, Provine demonstrated that oral inhalation and jaw gaping are necessary for a normal yawn; the motor program for yawning will not run to completion without feedback that these components have been executed.\n\nYawning, however, is a powerful, generalized movement that involves far more than airway maneuvers and jaw gaping. During a yawn, one also stretches facial muscles, tilts the head back, narrows or closes the eyes, produces tears, salivates, opens the Eustachian tubes of the middle ear, and performs numerous other, yet unspecified, cardiovascular and respiratory actions. Yawning may share components with other behaviors; for example, it resembles a "slow sneeze," or perhaps a sneeze is a "fast yawn." Both share features such as jaw gaping, eye closing, and head tilting.\n\nYawning and stretching also share properties and may occur together as part of a global motor complex. Studies by J.I.P. de Vries and colleagues in the early 1980s, using ultrasound to chart fetal movements, observed a link between yawning and stretching. An extraordinary demonstration of this link occurs in individuals paralyzed on one side due to stroke. The British neurologist Sir Francis Walshe noted in 1923 that, when these individuals yawn, their otherwise paralyzed arm may rise and flex automatically in an "associated response." Yawning apparently activates undamaged, unconsciously controlled brain-motor connections, causing the paralyzed limb to move. Whether this response predicts recovery or has therapeutic value in preventing muscle deterioration remains unknown.\n\nProvine speculated that yawning may serve multiple functions, making it unrealistic to select a single purpose. Yawning appears to be associated with changes in behavioral state, signaling a switch from one activity to another. It also serves as a reminder that ancient, unconscious behaviors linking humans to the animal world persist beneath the veneer of culture, rationality, and language.	Yawning
202510240853287539	Vietnam, a viable nation located on the eastern edge of the Indochinese Peninsula, is renown for its diverse geography that stretches from towering mountains in the north to fertile deltas in the south. Its prime location along the South China Sea makes it prone to seasonal typhoons, a reality that officials must constantly address through sustainable development strategies. \n\nThe country’s agricultural output benefits from its vast river systems, which have been a fundamental source of livelihood for generations, irrespective of economic or political changes. In schooling, Vietnamese students demonstrate remarkable intellect and competence, which contributes to a growing workforce capable of supporting industrial establishments across the nation.\n\nThe government continues to allocate incentives to improve infrastructure, ensuring that both urban and rural areas can thrive without facing deficiency in resources or education. Yet, corruption and downsides in certain administrative processes have proven detrimental to progress, especially when expenditure fails to reflect real community needs. \n\nOfficials are held accountable to disclose accurate data and enhance transparency so that awareness of public welfare issues remains informative and safe. Vietnam’s economic revenue continues to exceed expectations as the sector of tourism and manufacturing expands, though this phenomenon often increases emissions and consumption, posing challenges to environmental sustainability.\n\nDuring adolescence, many Vietnamese youth experience bullying or resent social pressure within academic settings, yet gifted individuals are encouraged to embrace their capabilities and rise above a mediocre mindset. The nation’s affluence is not uniform, as numerous rural regions still face insufficient access to clean water and nutritional resources. \n\nDespite these downsides, the government seeks to addressed inequalities and enhance living standards through infrastructure projects and incentives for local entrepreneurs. The merit of Vietnam’s growth lies in its ability to balance modernization with environmental preservation, ensuring that progress is not dangerous but safe for future generations. \n\nPeople frequently unwind along Vietnam’s beautiful coastlines, finding solace in the landscape’s notable serenity, which continues to establish Vietnam as one of Southeast Asia’s most geographically and culturally distinctive nations.

202510280907086205	For hundreds of years, historians have relied on written or printed documents to provide the bulk of their source materials, and they have largely communicated with students and the wider public by writing books and journal articles. Today, however, the printed word is being superseded by a diversity of forms of communication, above all moving images on video or film.\n\nA. The development of this new form of communication is leading to a growing gap between the practice of professional historians based in academia, and the practice of those aiming to popularise the study of history among the general public, and to encourage people to create their own records for the future. On the one hand, there are mainstream academics who continue to use only the written word as they examine more and more fields with an ever-increasing number of sophisticated methodologies. On the other hand, film and video, especially as broadcast on television, are probably the major influence on the public's consciousness of history, as they see film of events of fifty or a hundred years ago, events they had previously only read about.\n\nB. In a related development, a great many people now document local and family events in the form of videos; many schools, too, produce video yearbooks. All these visual records may well prove to be invaluable sources of information for future historians. The glaring contradiction is that the two approaches—the academic and what we might term the popular—have intersected very little: with a few notable exceptions, professional historians have tended to avoid involvement in television programmes about history, and have even less impact on what is being captured and preserved on video. And the potential of moving images has wielded negligible influence on the academic study of history.\n\nC. This gulf can be seen as resulting from the willingness, or otherwise, of individual historians to accept the validity of new forms of communication in the study of history. This is not the first time that the question has arisen. The study of history, as conceived of today, began with the transition from oral to literate culture, leading to the earliest written records and the earliest historical studies. The next great shift came with the advent of printing, which transformed everything. Today, as the printed word loses its dominance, historians are faced with a variety of forms of communication, ranging from simple audiotape to the promising complexities of videodiscs linked with computers. As yet, however, the use of moving images to record current events for the benefit of future historians does not even have a commonly agreed name.\n\nD. This does not mean that mainstream historians have totally rejected the use of moving images as sources: the majority seem intrigued by the idea, and valuable research has been carried out into the history and analysis of films with a broad circulation, using them as a source of information on the social and intellectual history of the twentieth century. Journals such as American History Review have played a significant role in this field.\n\nE. Yet the number of historians using moving images in their research or teaching is very small. The barrier seems to be that the profession is structured around the medium of the written word and is somewhat insulated in its academic setting. The use of moving images presents a substantial challenge to this setting and its assumptions. As a result, historians have rejected the training, the institutions, the motivations, and the professional structures that would be needed in order to use moving images effectively. Above all, they have rejected the necessity to learn complicated new skills.\n\nF. So why should historians make this change? Clearly, films or videos of events and people can be used as solid evidence of the past, linked to the words of the narrator (whether a television presenter/historian or a university teacher giving a lecture), but carrying information in their own right. Film has reintroduced the oral form as a mode of research and communication for documenting historical events. Now, with moving images, people are reminded that oral communication is not limited to words: it also includes body language, expression, and tone, and is embedded in a context. Little of this is evident in a written transcript. A further effect of video and film is that the narrator gives up some control and has less need to give explanations, while the viewer becomes involved in the process of interpreting and understanding history.\n\nG. Film or videotape can also aid historians by simplifying the work of the interviewer. Instead of trying to carry on an interview while simultaneously making notes about setting and other unspoken data, this new kind of historian can concentrate on the interview itself and study the film later. The many benefits of using moving images as historical evidence easily outweigh worries about cost, technical skills, or the effect of a camera on a person telling his or her story. Moving images enhance the quality of historical research and suggest new directions for historians to explore.	A new stage in the study and teaching of history
202510281704394279	📰 An Unusual Enemy\n\nOne October evening in 2016, an Arkansas farmer sat in his pickup truck just outside his field, growing impatient. Suddenly, another car pulled up beside him, so the farmer got out. Seconds later, he was murdered. The farmer’s name was Mike Wallace, and his death wasn’t about money or land — it was about a herbicide, a chemical meant to kill weeds.\n\nThis herbicide spread fear through rural America, turning farmers against each other. It belonged to a powerful company whose policies created deep divisions in farming communities. If you had the wrong seeds in your field, the company could send investigators to your door or drag you into court. Many farmers were bankrupted simply for trying to make a living.\n\nBy the time its dominance peaked, the company controlled more than 80 percent of the seeds planted in the United States. Through legal maneuvering and political influence, it built what was essentially a monopoly on American farmland. Behind the scenes, executives colluded with corrupt officials and manipulated scientific evidence to protect their products. Their chemicals, meanwhile, were destroying the health of communities around the world.\n\nThis is the story of Monsanto, one of the most powerful agricultural corporations on the planet. Our investigation draws on publicly available documents, recordings, and independent reports — all of which are linked in the description. To understand how this company rose to power, we have to go back to the 1940s, when a chemist fighting poison ivy made an unexpected discovery.\n\n🌿 The Chemist and the Poison Ivy\n\nIn 1942, a chemist named Franklin D. Jones developed a personal vendetta against poison ivy. His children suffered violent allergic reactions to the plant, breaking out in rashes and swelling whenever they brushed against it. Determined to eliminate the source, Jones began experimenting with hormones — chemicals that regulate a plant’s growth in much the same way hormones do in humans and animals. He hoped that one of these compounds would cause the ivy to die.\n\nAt first, nothing worked. Some chemicals had no effect at all, while others made the ivy grow faster. But one day, Jones noticed something unusual: certain plants began to turn autumn colors long before they should have. Their vibrant leaves curled, darkened, and within days, the ivy shriveled up and died. Jones had finally found a chemical that could destroy poison ivy at its core.\n\n⚗️ The Birth of 2,4-D\n\nThe chemical responsible was a synthetic growth hormone called 2,4-D. Its structure consisted of a benzene ring — a chain of six carbon atoms — with an acid tail and two chlorine atoms attached at positions two and four. Hence the name, 2,4-D. What Jones discovered next would change agriculture forever.\n\nIn small doses, 2,4-D stimulated plant growth, but in larger amounts, it caused uncontrollable, cancer-like growth that killed the plant. It was, in essence, plant cancer in a bottle. Even more remarkable, the grass surrounding the ivy barely reacted to the chemical at all. It appeared that 2,4-D could target certain plants while leaving others untouched — a trait that made it uniquely valuable.\n\n🌱 A New Kind of Weapon\n\nOver the next two years, Jones conducted more than a hundred experiments across different species. He found that 2,4-D killed broad-leaved weeds such as dandelions, chickweed, and poison ivy, but left grasses like wheat, corn, and barley unharmed. To refine it further, he experimented with similar compounds, eventually developing 2,4,5-T, which was even less harmful to grasses.\n\nBefore this discovery, farmers had only two choices: use dangerous chemicals like arsenic or pull weeds out by hand. Both were slow, labor-intensive, and hazardous. With 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, they could spray an entire field and kill only the weeds. Jones had created the first selective herbicides — chemicals that could distinguish between crops and intruders.\n\n💡 The Postwar Boom\n\nIn 1945, as World War II came to an end, Jones patented his invention. When wartime secrecy laws were lifted, scientists around the world — in the United States and the United Kingdom — announced they had made similar discoveries independently. Soon, the market exploded with so-called “miracle weed killers” such as Weedone, Weed-A-Bomb, and Endo-Weed, all based on 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.\n\nAdvertisements promised a new era of effortless farming. “This man is ready to kill weeds — the easy way,” one ad boasted. These chemicals replaced the hoe and transformed everything from farms to railroad tracks to suburban lawns. By the late 1940s, the herbicide industry had grown into a ten-million-dollar powerhouse — and Monsanto was at the center of it all.	Exposing Why Farmers Can't Legally Replant Their Own Seeds - Part 1: An Unusual Enemy - Veritasium
202510291258255325	A Sometime in the early Cretaceous period of Earth’s history, a certain type of hunting wasp evolved into bees by adopting a vegetarian diet. They began to rely increasingly on the pollen of plants as a source of protein for themselves and their offspring, instead of consuming insects. In doing so, they inadvertently transported pollen on their bodies to other plants of the same species, facilitating pollination. This set the stage for a succession of increasingly specialized mutual adaptations between bees and flowering plants. In particular, flowers began to reward bees for their unwitting role in reproduction by providing richer sources of pollen and an additional source of nutrition, nectar.\n\nB Today, about 15 percent of our diet consists of crops pollinated by bees. The meat and other animal products we consume are ultimately derived from bee-pollinated forage crops, which account for another 15 percent. Consequently, around one-third of our food is directly or indirectly dependent on the pollination services of bees. Globally, the annual value of agricultural crops reliant on bee pollination is estimated at £1,000 million (US$1,590 million). Much of this pollination is provided by honeybees, and in monetary terms, it exceeds the value of the annual honey crop by a factor of fifty.\n\nC However, the seemingly harmonious relationship between bees and plants conceals a conflict of interests. Although flowers need bees and vice versa, each partner benefits from minimizing costs and maximizing gains. While this may sound like an extreme case of attributing human qualities to non-human species, using concepts from marketplaces and double-entry bookkeeping as metaphors can provide insight into what is really happening between bees and flowering plants. In reality, both flowers and bees operate in a competitive “marketplace.” A community of retailers—the flowers—competes to attract more or less discriminating consumers—the bees. Each flower must balance the costs and benefits of investing in advertising, through color and scent, and providing rewards, such as nectar and pollen. A species dependent on cross-pollination is on a knife-edge: it must provide enough nectar to attract a bee but not so much that the bee satisfies all its needs in one visit. A satiated bee would return to its nest rather than visit another flower. The bee, on the other hand, seeks to maximize its intake of pollen and nectar, assessing the quality and quantity of available rewards and managing its energy expenditure to ensure a caloric profit from each foraging trip. The apparent harmony between plants and bees is therefore an equilibrium founded on compromises between competing interests.\n\nD This dynamic closely resembles the ideas of the 18th-century economist Adam Smith. In The Wealth of Nations, Smith argued that the competitive interactions of different “economic units” in human society eventually produce a balanced, or “harmonious,” system. One might predict, therefore, that economists would find the relationships between bees and plants intriguing. This is indeed the case in Israel, where economists are collaborating with botanists and entomologists in a long-term study of the pollination biology of native flora to better understand the dynamics of interactions between bee and plant communities.\n\nE Such studies are of more than passing academic interest. Authorities must understand the dynamic relationships between plants and their pollinators, particularly when formulating conservation policies. A notable example comes from the forests of tropical South America. Here, as in all rainforests, tree species diversity is high, with more than 120 species per acre; yet in a given acre, there may be only one or two individuals of any particular species. These trees are pollinated by large, fast-flying bees. Evidence shows that certain bees learn the distribution of these scattered trees and follow regular foraging routes, a behavior known as “trap-lining.” Some bees forage up to 23 km from their nests, acting as long-distance pollinators.\n\nF A current concern in tropical forest conservation is estimating the minimum sustainable size of “islands” of forest reserves in areas undergoing large-scale logging. While seed dispersal distances have received much attention, they represent only part of the reproductive equation for trees. Another crucial factor is whether proposed forest reserves are close enough to larger tracts of forest for long-distance pollinators to maintain connectivity. To answer this, we need much more information about bees and their interactions with plants.\n\nG Bees, therefore, are vital to human survival. Moreover, much of the visual impact of human environments derives from vegetation, most of which depends on bees for pollination. As pollinators of both crops and natural vegetation, bees occupy key positions in the web of relationships that sustain the living architecture of our planet.	The Ecological Importance of Bees
202510301245140088	Fishbourne Roman Palace is in the village of Fishbourne in West Sussex, England. This large palace was built in the 1st century AD, around thirty years after the Roman conquest of Britain ,on the site of Roman army grain stores which had been established after the invasion, in the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius in 43 AD. The rectangular palace was built around formal gardens, the northern half of which have been reconstructed. There were extensive alterations in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, with many of the original black and white mosaic floors being overlaid with more sophisticated coloured ones , including a perfectly preserved mosaic of a dolphin in the north wing. More alterations were in progress when the palace burnt down in around 270AD,after which it was abandoned.\n\nLocal people had long believed that a Roman palace once existed in the area .However, it was not until 1960 that the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe, of Oxford University, first systematically excavated the site, after workmen had accidentally uncovered a wall while they were laying a water main .The Roman villa excavated by Cunliffe's team was so grand that it became known as Fishbourne Roman Palace ,and a museum was erected to preserve some of the remains .This is administered by the Sussex Archaeological Society.\n\nIn its day, the completed palace would have comprised four large wings with colonnaded fronts. The north and east wings consisted of suites of private rooms built around courtyards, with a monumental entrance in the middle of the east wing. In the north-east corner there was an assembly hall. The west wing contained state rooms, a large ceremonial reception room, and a gallery. The south wing contained the owner’s private apartments. The palace included as many as 50 mosaic floors, under-floor central heating and a bathhouse. In size, Fishbourne Palace would have been approximately equivalent to some of the great Roman palaces of Italy, and was by far the largest known Roman residence north of the European Alps, at about 500 feet (150m)square. A team of volunteers and professional archaeologists are involved in an ongoing archaeological excavation on the site of nearby, possibly military, buildings.\n\nThe first buildings to be erected on the site were constructed in the early part of the conquest in 43 AD. Later, two timber buildings were constructed, one with clay and mortar floors and plaster walls, which appears to have been a house of some comfort. These buildings were demolished in the 60s AD and replaced by a substantial stone house, which included colonnades, and a bath suite. It has been suggested that the palaces itself, incorporating the previous house in its south-east corner, was constructed around 73-75 AD. However, Dr Miles Russell, of Bournemouth University, reinterpreted the ground plan and the collection of objects found and has suggested that, given the extremely close parallels with the imperial palace of Domitian in Rome, its construction may more plausibly date to after 92 AD.\n\nWith regard to who lived in Fishbourne Palace, there are a number of theories; for example ,one proposed by Professor Cunliffe is that ,in its early phase, the palace was the residence of Tiberius\n\nClaudius Cogidubnus ,a local chieftain who supported the Romans ,and who may have been installed as king of a number of territories following the first stage of the conquest. Cogidubnus is known from a reference to his loyalty in Agricola, a work by the Roman writer Tacitus, and from an inscription commemorating a temple dedicated to the gods Neptune and Minerva found in the nearby city of Chichester. Another theory is that it was built for Sallustius Lucullus, a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century, who may have been the son of the British prince Adminius. Two inscriptions recording the presence of Lucullus have been found in Chichester, and the redating by Miles Russell of the palace was designed for Lucullus, then it may have only been in use for a few years, as the Roman historian Suetonius records that Lucullus was executed by the Emperor Domitian in or shortly after 93 AD.\n\nAdditional theories suggest that either Verica, a British king of the Roman Empire in the years preceding the Claudian invasion, was owner of the palace, or Tiberius Claudius Catuarus , following the recent discovery of a gold ring belonging to him. The palace outlasted the original owner, whoever he was, and was extensively re-planned early in the 2nd century AD, and subdivided into a series of lesser apartments. Further redevelopment was begun in the late 3rd century AD, but these alterations were incomplete when the north wing was destroyed in a fire in around 270 AD. The damage was too great repair, and the palace was abandoned and later dismantled.\n\nA modern museum had been built by the Sussex Archaeological Society, incorporating most of the visible remains , including one wing of the palace. The gardens have been re-planted using authentic plants from the Roman period.	Fishbourne Roman Palace
